# fractol_linux
ecole42_Moskow fractol project build for linux
this is project where i found out how to comuter actually draw a picture :-)

before that project? i imagin about drawing in a "humanity" way.

now i get real understandin that a drowing - is not about drow dot and lines, 
drawind it' about set color to each pixel on the screen. 
Drawing, it's about calculating and setting color to each pixel on the screen and nothing more.
